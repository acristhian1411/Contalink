# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Enhance ProductsController for stock reversal
  - Modify the `updatePriceAndQty` method to handle 'sales_reversal' controller type
  - Add logic to increase product quantities when reversing sales
  - Maintain existing validation and error handling patterns
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.4, 3.5_

- [x] 2. Create SaleDeleteController with core deletion logic
  - Create new controller file following existing naming conventions
  - Implement main `destroy` method with database transaction wrapper
  - Add validation method to check if sale exists and can be deleted
  - Implement error handling following existing controller patterns
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 2.3, 5.1, 5.4_

- [x] 3. Implement stock reversal orchestration
  - Add method to retrieve sale details and calculate stock quantities to reverse
  - Integrate with enhanced ProductsController updatePriceAndQty method
  - Handle multiple products with different quantities in single sale
  - Add error handling for stock reversal failures
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.3, 3.5_

- [x] 4. Implement till movements deletion orchestration
  - Add method to find all TillDetails records associated with the sale
  - Orchestrate deletion of TillDetailProofPayments using existing controller
  - Orchestrate deletion of TillDetails using existing controller
  - Handle multiple payment methods and till entries per sale
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5_

- [x] 5. Implement sales data deletion orchestration
  - Add method to delete all SalesDetails using existing controller
  - Add method to delete main Sales record using existing controller
  - Ensure proper order of deletion to maintain referential integrity
  - Use existing soft delete functionality from controllers
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.2_

- [x] 6. Add comprehensive error handling and logging
  - Implement try-catch blocks with proper transaction rollback
  - Add detailed logging for each step of deletion process
  - Create appropriate error messages following existing patterns
  - Add validation for edge cases and constraint violations
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_

- [x] 7. Create API route for sales deletion
  - Add DELETE route to existing sales routes configuration
  - Follow existing route naming and parameter conventions
  - Ensure proper middleware and authentication are applied
  - Test route accessibility and parameter passing
  - _Requirements: 2.4_

- [ ]* 8. Write unit tests for SaleDeleteController
  - Create test file following existing test structure
  - Test successful deletion flow with mocked dependencies
  - Test error scenarios and transaction rollback behavior
  - Test validation methods and edge cases
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.1_

- [ ]* 9. Write integration tests for complete deletion flow
  - Create integration test with real database transactions
  - Test stock quantity restoration accuracy
  - Test till movement cleanup completeness
  - Test with various sale configurations and payment methods
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 3.1, 4.1_
