# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds the capability to delete sales transactions while maintaining data integrity by reversing the impact on product stock and cash movements. The deletion process must orchestrate multiple controllers following the existing architecture pattern established by SaleStoreController.

## Glossary

- **Sales_System**: The Laravel-based sales management system
- **Sale_Transaction**: A complete sales record including main sale, details, and payment information
- **Product_Stock**: The current quantity available for each product
- **Till_Movement**: Cash register transaction records (TillDetails)
- **Soft_Delete**: Laravel's soft delete mechanism that marks records as deleted without physical removal
- **Stock_Reversal**: The process of adding back quantities to products when a sale is deleted
- **Payment_Reversal**: The process of removing cash movements when a sale is deleted

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to delete sales transactions, so that incorrect or cancelled sales can be removed from the system while maintaining data integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a delete request is made for a sale, THE Sales_System SHALL validate that the sale exists and is not already deleted
2. WHEN a sale deletion is processed, THE Sales_System SHALL reverse all product stock changes made by the original sale
3. WHEN a sale deletion is processed, THE Sales_System SHALL remove all associated till movements (cash register entries)
4. WHEN a sale deletion is processed, THE Sales_System SHALL soft delete the main sale record and all related details
5. IF any step in the deletion process fails, THEN THE Sales_System SHALL rollback all changes and return an error response

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system user, I want the sales deletion to follow the existing architecture patterns, so that the system remains maintainable and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Sales_System SHALL create a new controller that orchestrates the deletion process similar to SaleStoreController
2. THE Sales_System SHALL use existing controller methods (destroy, update) from related controllers
3. THE Sales_System SHALL wrap the entire deletion process in a database transaction
4. THE Sales_System SHALL follow the same error handling patterns as existing controllers
5. THE Sales_System SHALL return consistent JSON responses following the established API format

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the stock reversal to be accurate, so that product quantities remain correct after sale deletions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reversing stock for a deleted sale, THE Sales_System SHALL add back the exact quantities that were originally sold
2. THE Sales_System SHALL use the existing ProductsController updatePriceAndQty method with appropriate parameters
3. THE Sales_System SHALL process all sale details to determine the correct quantities to reverse
4. THE Sales_System SHALL maintain the original product cost prices during stock reversal
5. IF stock reversal fails for any product, THEN THE Sales_System SHALL rollback the entire deletion process

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an accountant, I want till movements to be properly removed, so that cash register balances remain accurate after sale deletions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deleting a sale, THE Sales_System SHALL identify all related till detail records using the sale ID as reference
2. THE Sales_System SHALL soft delete all till detail records associated with the sale
3. THE Sales_System SHALL soft delete all till detail proof payment records associated with the till details
4. THE Sales_System SHALL use existing TillDetailsController and TillDetailProofPaymentsController destroy methods
5. THE Sales_System SHALL process all payment methods that were used in the original sale

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error handling, so that partial deletions do not corrupt the system data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Sales_System SHALL use database transactions to ensure atomicity of the deletion process
2. IF any controller operation fails, THEN THE Sales_System SHALL rollback all changes made during the deletion
3. THE Sales_System SHALL log detailed error information for troubleshooting purposes
4. THE Sales_System SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages
5. THE Sales_System SHALL validate all required data before beginning the deletion process
